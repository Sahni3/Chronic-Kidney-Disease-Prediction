# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction

This Project used supervised machine learning techniques to build an optimized classification model for chronic kidney disease classification and predict whether person has chronic disease or not.

We will use Chronic kidney disease Dataset provided by Kaggle. This dataset consists of 400 records with 26 columns that explain about the which person has disease of what age, haemoglobin, appet, rbc and etc.

We will analyze this dataset using Machine learning techniques and visualize optimization of hyper-parameters and marking optimal value on 3-D plots in order to predict the person has chronic disease or not based on the features provided in the columns of the dataset. We will begin the Data Science Life Cycle to process the data such as Cleaning the dataset, feature engineering, splitting dataset, feature selection and developed & Evaluated model on XGBoost and Tuned the final model using RandomizedSearchCV to reach the best accuracy of 97%.
